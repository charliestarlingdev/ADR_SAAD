# ADR-0003: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-07

## Context
The system requires relational data storage with strong consistency,
support for multi-tenancy, and good performance at moderate scale.

The team has prior SQL experience and limited time for onboarding.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for the application.

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL
- Pros: Widely used, good performance
- Cons: Fewer advanced features for tenancy and extensions

### MongoDB
- Pros: Flexible schema
- Cons: We require strong relational constraints and transactions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Mature ecosystem
- Good support for migrations and tooling

### Negative
- Requires schema management
- Less flexible than document databases

## Rationale
PostgreSQL best aligns with the data consistency requirements and the
team’s existing experience, reducing risk and development time.
