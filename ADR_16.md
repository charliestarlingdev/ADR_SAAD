# ADR-16: Build a Custom Authentication System

## Status: *Rejected*

### Context
A fully custom authentication system was initially considered to keep everything within the CMS.

### Decision
I rejected this approach and delegated authentication to tenant-managed systems.

### Consequences
+ Would provide full control over authentication behaviour.

- Introduces unnecessary security risk and increased development and maintenance effort.
