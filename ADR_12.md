# ADR-12: Separate Structural and Behavioural Code Diagrams

## Status: *Accepted*

### Context
Attempting to show structure and behaviour in a single diagram reduced clarity.

### Decision
I created separate structural and behavioural code diagrams.

### Consequences
+ Improves clarity at code level.
+ Makes it easier to reason about responsibilities and interactions.

- Requires additional documentation effort.
